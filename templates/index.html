    <h1>Securitisation Regulation - Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council and the UK
    Securitisation Regulation</h1>
    <p>Securitisation relates to a form of financing whereby an entity ("Originator" or "Seller")
        holds financial claims usually in the form of rights to payment of an outstanding debt ("receivables")
        transfers the rights to those claims usually through a sale ("true sale") to a company or other legal
        entity set up for the purpose of holding the claims ("securitisation special purpose entity") which
        aggregates the assets into a collateral pool ("exposures") and then issues notes to fund the purchase.
        The notes are tranched into tiers with the highest tier having first claim on the pool of exposures
        and the second tier and subsequent tiers being subordinated to each higher tier, therefore having the next
        or subsequent claim after higher claims are satisfied and until the return from the pool of exposures is
        exhausted. The default and expected loss rates applicable to the exposures determine the amount of
        subordination that is required in order to achieve a relevant credit rating applied to the respective
        tranche.</p>
    <p>Typically, this approach is used in relation to receivables such as residential loans, auto loans,
        credit cards, leases, consumer loans and in certain cases various types of business or commercial assets.</p>

    <p>This form of financing is subject to a number of regulatory requirements. In order to confirm the regulatory
    requirements are complied with follow the procedure set out below.</p>

    <p>1. Determine if the transaction or scheme is a securitisation within the regulatory definition.</p>

    <p>2. If it is a securitisation determine the relevant regulatory due diligence requirements.</p>

    <p>3. Consider where the investors are based and the regulatory regime that applies based on jurisdiction of
    relevant participants.</p>

    <p>4. Depending on the applicable regulations confirm the entity that will act as the risk retainer.</p>

    <p>5. Ensure the risk retention entity complies with relevant regulatory requirements</p>

    <p>6. Confirm the form of risk retention and that this complies with relevant requirements.</p>

    <p>7. Confirm reporting entity and compliance with transparency and reporting requirements.</p>

    <p>8. Certify the information input into this site is correct and subject to verification and normal
        assumptions and reservations receive confirmation that the regulatory risk retention requirements are complied
        with to the extent of the available guidance. </p>
