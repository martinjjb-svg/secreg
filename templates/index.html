    <p class="lead" style="color:white">This guide determines if your transaction is a securitisation and if it
        is subject to the requirements set out within the EU Securitisation Regulation or the UK Securitisation
        Regulation or both. If the transaction is subject to the Regulations the guide takes you through the
        process of determining if it is compliant with the current Regulations.</p>

    <h4>Securitisation Regulation refers to the application of the Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament
         and of the Council in respect of securitisations in the EU and the UK Securitisation Regulation in respect of
    securitisations in the UK (together the "Regulations").</h4>
    <p>Securitisation relates to a form of financing whereby an entity ("originator" or "sponsor") establishes a structure
        in which financial claims, usually in the form of rights to payment of an outstanding debt ("receivables") are
        transferred from the originator or original lender, usually through a sale ("true sale") to a company or other legal
        entity set up for the purpose of holding the claims ("securitisation special purpose entity" or "SSPE"). The SSPE
        aggregates the assets into a collateral pool ("exposures") and then issues notes to fund the purchase.
        The notes are tranched into tiers with the highest tier having first claim on the payments arising from the exposures
        and the second tier and subsequent tiers being subordinated to each higher tier, therefore having the next
        or subsequent claim after higher claims are satisfied until payments from the pool of exposures is
        exhausted. The default and expected loss rates applicable to the exposures determine the amount of
        subordination that is required in order to achieve a relevant credit rating applied to the respective
        tranche.</p>
    <p>Typically, this approach is used in relation to receivables such as residential loans, auto loans,
        credit cards, leases, consumer loans and in certain cases various types of business or commercial assets.</p>

    <p>This form of financing is subject to a number of regulatory requirements. In order to confirm if the regulatory
    requirements are complied with it is possible to follow the procedure set out below.</p>

    <p>1. Determine if the transaction or scheme is a securitisation within the regulatory definition.</p>

    <p>2. If it is a securitisation determine if the originator, sponsor or SSPE are subject to the Regulations.</p>

    <p>3. Consider where the investors are based and if they are subject to the Regulations based on the jurisdiction of
    the relevant investors.</p>

    <p>4. If the securitisation is subject to the Regulations check that it complies with the applicable regulatory
        requirements requiring an appropriate entity to retain a required net material economic interest in the
        securitisation.</p>

    <p>5. Check that the risk retention entity complies with eligibility requirements applicable nder the Regulations.</p>

    <p>6. Confirm the form of risk retention instrument and that this complies with relevant requirements.</p>

    <p>7. Confirm reporting entity and compliance with credit granting and transparency and reporting requirements.</p>

    <p>8. If securitisation meets all above requirements and information input into this site is correct, subject
        to verification and normal assumptions and reservations the regulatory risk retention requirements are complied
        with to the extent of the available guidance. </p>
