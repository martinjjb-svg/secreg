  <h1>Securitisation Regulation - Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council</h1>
  <p>Securitisation relates to transactions that enable an entity to refinance certain types of financial
      assets by aggregating the assets into a pool and then tranching the pool to achieve expected loss
      rates applicable to the exposures by respective tranch. Typically this approach is used in relation to
      receivables such as residential loans, auto loans, credit cards, leases, other consumer loans and
      in certain cases various types of business or commercial assets. </p>
