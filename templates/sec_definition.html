    <p style="color:brown"><strong>Is the transaction a transaction or scheme where the credit risk associated with an exposure or
      pool of exposures is tranched? </strong></p><p>(A tranche is “a contractually established segment of the credit risk associated
    with an exposure or a pool of exposures (typically loans or other financial receivables or claims), where a position
    in the segment entails a risk of credit loss greater than or less than a position of the same amount in each other
    segment, without taking account of credit protection provided by third parties directly to the holders of positions
    in the segment or in other segments.”) </p>

    <p style="color:brown"><strong>Are payments in the transaction/scheme dependent upon the performance of the exposures or of the
      pool of exposures? </strong></p><p>This will be the case where, for example, the ability of the issuer to pay interest on its
      obligations is dependent on receiving payments that will fall due in respect of the assets it has acquired. This
    is most clear in relation to receivables pools where the payments of interest and principle from underlying obligors
    are used to pay the interest and principal that will become due on the notes/loans funding the purchase.</p>

    <br>
    <p style="color:brown"><strong>Does the subordination of tranches determine the distribution of losses during the ongoing life of the
      transaction or scheme? </strong></p><p>This will typically apply where the structure applies a payment waterfall, a contractual
      priority of payments such that amounts available to the issuer are contractually applied first to more senior
    tranches of debt on each payment date and then applied to each subsequent tranche by virtue of subordination
    to the extent that amounts are available to make the payments. A failure to pay a subordinated tranche due to
    insufficient cashflow from the acquired assets will not be an event of default on the structure as a whole.</p>

    <p style="color:brown"><strong>Does the transaction constitute a specialised lending transaction ie it has characteristics listed in
      Article 147(8) of Reg (EU) No 575/2013 (The Capital Requirements Regulation)? </strong></p><p> Specialised lending exposures include
      commercial real estate, project finance, ship and aircraft, and the like, which are provided by sophisticated lenders
      using structures which might be caught due to the structure involving the characteristics of tranching, payments depending
      upon performance, and subordination. Article 147(8) specifies the following characteristics: 1."the exposure is to
      an entity which was created specifically to finance or operate physical assets or is an economically comparable
      exposure; 2. the contractual arrangements give the lender a substantial degree of control over the assets and the
      income that they generate; 3. the primary source of repayment of the obligation is the income generated by the
      assets being financed, rather than the independent capacity of a broader commercial enterprise". Limb (c) of the
      definition emphasises the related recital (6) (which itself repeats the final sentence of recital (50) of the CRR):
      "An exposure that creates a direct payment obligation for a transaction or scheme used to finance or operate
      physical assets should not be considered an exposure to a securitisation, even if the transaction or scheme has
      payment obligations of different seniority".</p>
